# Required

1. Azure Machine Learning Resouces

# Step by Step Instruction

1. Choose Compute and Click New button

![Create compute instance](https://harryteststorageblob.blob.core.windows.net/blogazureimage/Image/studio/cs_studio_compute_instance.png)

Set the name for the compute you want. The default region will be the same region that you set your Machine Learning resource. You can choose the Virtual Machine size that fit your scenario. Note that this compute resource is used to run your Jupyter Notebook only, so you might not need to choose a high-performance setting unless you need to process large dataset.

Now, you have successfully created the compute resource. Let's head back to the Machine Learning Studio to run some notebooks.

You can write regular [markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) here and Jekyll will automatically convert it to a nice webpage.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](http://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/headings/tables/etc.

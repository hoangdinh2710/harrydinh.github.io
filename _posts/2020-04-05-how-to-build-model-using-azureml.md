# Requirement

1. Machine Learning Resouce

See how to create a new machine learning resource here

# Step by Step Instruction

1. Open Azure Machine Learn Studio

First, let's open the Azure Machine Learning portal. Click "Launch Now" to open Azure Machine Learn Studio.

2. Get data

Data is the most important resource for a machine learning project. Data scientist often spend 70% of their time gathering, processing and cleaning data. Microsoft offer many open datasets that we can use right away. For the scope of this tutorial, we will use one the open dataset. 

Choose the "Datasets" from the left panel, and click "Create dataset:

![Click Create Dataset](https://harryteststorageblob.blob.core.windows.net/blogazureimage/Image/studio/cs_studio_create_dataset.png)

I will choose the "Diabetes" dataset for this tutorial and name it "diabetes" (very creative name!)

Done! Now we have created the data successfully. Let's move to the next step to create a machine learning model from this dataset.

3. Generate Traning Scripts

**Required:** 
- Compute Instance

See step-by-step instruction on how to create Compute Instance here

Note: the compute instance works like a VMs, which help us to run the Jupyter Notebook in the Azure Machine Learning Studio directly. You can always download the data and run the Jupyter Notebook locally to generate the training scripts.

From Azure Machine Learning Studio, open the Notebooks section:

![Open Notebook](https://harryteststorageblob.blob.core.windows.net/blogazureimage/Image/studio/cs_studio_notebook.png)

We will create a new folder name "Diabetes" to store all the scripts

Add new Jupyter Notebook file
